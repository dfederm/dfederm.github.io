I have no desire to collect, store, or sell personal data. However, this site uses the following third party integrations which may collect visitor data and have their own privacy policies.

* Google Analytics: Used to collect aggregated statistics so that I can occasionally, for example, see which posts are popular and which people find less interesting.

* Google Ads: Supports the site financially.

* Affiliate links: Supports the site by earning a commission from certain links. This does not affect your purchases or the price you may pay.

* Disqus: Allows users to comment on posts.
